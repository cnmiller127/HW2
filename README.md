#Responsive Portfolio

*Bootstrap was used for navs, forms, footer.
*Bootstrap was used for mobile responsiveness using default breakpoints
*Format is the same for index, portfolio, contact pages for each corresponding breakpoint
*Float left and media queries were used to wrap text for index page
   *This is only use of custom media queries. Necessary for responsive image
*Background photo used on all 3 pages: https://www.freepik.com/free-photos-vectors/background
*Used abs positioning for image banners on portfolio. Parent conatiner set to relative positioning
*Consistent padding amd margins for flush text, images...etc
*Placeholder img used for future changes to portfolio
*Custom css used for responsive image
   *img-fluid class does not work properly with bootstrap grid. had to create own. My understanding
   is that this is due to the grid making its elements flex items
*Justify content was helpful in horizontally aligning items within the container for respective breakpoints
*Bootstrap padding and margins made layout simple
*Used google fonts for header
